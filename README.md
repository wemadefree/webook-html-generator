# webook-html-generator

The purpose of the WeBook HTML Generator application is to generate html pages that will be displayed on screens. The application connects to the WeBook API service and collects the necessary data to generate html.

## Evironment file
In order to work properly, you need to rename the .env_sample file to .env and fill in the required variables.

## Poetry
The application relies on the Poetry dependancy management system:
- Install poetry: https://realpython.com/dependency-management-python-poetry/#take-care-of-prerequisites
- In top folder (where poetry.toml file is located) create virtual environment
-  ```bash
poetry env use python3
or 
poetry env use python

```
- Work with poetry: https://realpython.com/dependency-management-python-poetry/#work-with-python-poetry
